# Kite with circle highlight Icons

## Introduction

Kite-with-circle-highlight Icons is a freedesktop.org compatible icon theme subset. It inherits the KDE Breeze Icons theme, except has modified titlebar buttons to match the Kite button icon style with Circle button highlight style.

This is designed to match https://github.com/paulmcauley/classikstyles or https://www.pling.com/p/1482837/

## Guidelines

The Breeze icons guidelines are described at [develop.kde.org/hig](https://develop.kde.org/hig).
