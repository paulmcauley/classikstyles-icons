# Classik-with-circle-highlight Icons

## Introduction

Classik-with-circle-highlight Icons is a freedesktop.org compatible icon theme subset. It inherits the KDE Breeze Icons theme, except has modified titlebar buttons to match the Classik button icon style with Circle button highlight style.

This is designed to match https://github.com/paulmcauley/classik or https://www.pling.com/p/1367676/
